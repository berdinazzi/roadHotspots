\title{Kernel density estimation on roads}
\usage{
road_kernel (count_path, roads_path, bandw = 500, group = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{count_path}{Path for the .csv file with the location of the observations. 
The file must have three headed columns (ID, x coordinate and y coordinate) 
with one observation per row. The coordinates must have the same projection as 
the roads shapefile. The header names are indiferent but 
the columns position must be as described.}

\item{roads_path}{Path for the .shp file with the roads}

\item{bandw}{Vector of bandwidths for x and y directions. 
A scalar value will be taken to apply to both directions.}

\item{group}{String used to subset species/groups from 
the observations dataframe. Can be a single string or multiple strings. 
For multiple strings use: c("spe1", "spe2"). By default all observations
are used.}
}
\value{
A SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object with the kernel 
density estimation
}
\description{
Kernel density estimation on roads using the function \code{\link[MASS]{kde2d}}
from package MASS.
}
\details{
Observations are snaped to closest roads prior to  
estimation and the resulting kernel is clipped to the road. The kernel 
density estimation is rescaled to [0, 1] and recoded in 
three categories: 1 = 0.25 to 0.50, 2 = 0.50 to 0.75,
3 = 0.75 to 1
}
\examples{
roads_path <- system.file("extdata/roads.shp", package = "roadHotspots")
count_path <- system.file("extdata/count.csv", package = "roadHotspots")
output <- road_kernel(count_path, roads_path)
