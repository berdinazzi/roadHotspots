\title{Identify hotspots on roads}
\usage{
road_malo (count_path, roads_path, thresh = 0.95, split_length = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_path}{Path for the .csv file with the location of the observations. 
The file must have three headed columns (id, x coordinate and y coordinate) 
with one observation per row. The coordinates must have the same projection as}

\item{roads_path}{Path for the .shp file with the roads. The file must have}

\item{thresh}{Hotspot probability threshold. Can assume values in the range [0, 1]}

\item{split_length}{Length of the road segments in map units}
}
\value{
SpatialLinesDataFrame object with the road segments identified as hotspots
}
\description{
Identify hotspots on roads using an adaptation of Malo et al. (2004) method.
}
\details{
The road sections with high observation rates are defined 
by detecting clusters of animal locations. The spatial pattern of observations is 
compared with that expected in a random situation. Based on the hypothesis
that observations for each road section would show a 
Poisson distribution (Boots & Getis 1988), the probability of any 
road segment having x number of observations is: p(x) = λx/(x!eλ).
Hotspots are then defined as those segments whose probability of observations
is lower than the threshold probability. For instance a 0.95 threshold value 
means that segments whose number of observations have less than 5% probability
of ocurrence (1-0.95 = 0.05), given the observations distribution, are considered hotspots
